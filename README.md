# NDMC training
Materials for the HPV modelling workshops at the National Disease Modelling Consortium, Mumbai, India, September 2023


## Installation
You can clone, fork, or download this repository to get a local copy of all the scripts.

## Setting up and running
For some of these scripts, you will need to have [HPVsim](http://hpvsim.org). Follow the instructions at each of those locations to install them. You may wish to install them within a conda environment, then use that same conda environment when running the scripts.

Once you have installed HPVsim, you can run test_install to make sure that everything is working correctly.

Other scripts do not require HPVsim. Check the package imports at the top of each script to see what's required.

## Structure
- the folder `hpvsim_india` contains scripts for running HPVsim for Uganda.
- the folder `exercises` contains scripts for running exercises covered during the training.
