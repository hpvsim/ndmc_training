# Calibration

This example includes the code required to run a multi-location calibration. The structure is as follows:

- Data are in the `data` folder.
- `behavior_inputs.py` contains sexual behavior parameters, including mixing and age of debut.
- `calibration.py` contains the Python class for performing multi-location calibration.
- `locations.py` defines the locations being used.
- `run_multical.py` is the script that actually runs the multi-location calibration.
- `run_sim.py` runs a single simulation for a given location.
